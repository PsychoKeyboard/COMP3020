# Ripple Recipe Search

Ripple is a simple website that allows users to select ingredients they have in their kitchen to curate a list of recipes based on number of ingredients present.

## Description

From the homepage, you can go to three pages: "Search", "Pantry" and "Get Recipes" which are also interconnected, allowing seamless transitions in between without needing to pass through the home page. Select the ingredients of your choice from either the "Search" or the "Pantry" page and hit "Get Recipes" in the top right to get some of your recipes. The ingredients you have selected will be visible in a drop down when you hover on "Basket" (top right).

In order to get all of the recipes in the current database please choose:

- Oil

- Salt

- Pepper

- Sugar

- Onion
