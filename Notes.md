# Intro to HCI

**Human-computer interaction** is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

**User Interface:** A program that controls a display for the user and that allows the user to interact with the system

An **interface** refers to what is presented to the user Could be a visual, physical, or auditory
presentation Includes what you can manipulate.

An **interaction** is the dialogue between the computer and the user The actions the user must invoke to perform a task and the corresponding responses The dialogue is ongoing

**Gulf of Execution** : The manner in which the user must
translate his/her plans into input the
system can understand is not always
natural or intuitive

**Gulf of Evaluation:** A Gulf of Evaluation arises when the
users has trouble interpreting system
output in light of his/her goals


# Usability Goals


Designers produce primary usability objectives
throughout the process of requirements gathering
E.g., Should the system promote efficiency over
creativity, both, or any other objective?

These primary objectives are referred to as
usability goals and user experience goals

A **usability goal** addresses the issue of meeting a
specific usability criteria

A **user experience goal** is concerned with the
quality of the userâ€™s experience with the system

**Usability criteria:** Something that can be measured to
determine if the goal is being met
4


## Usabiltiy Goals:

- **Effectiveness:** Concerned with whether the system is
doing what it generally says it will do
- **Efficiency:** Considers how much time it will take users to
perform their tasks
Generally the more steps it takes to carry out a task,
the less efficient a system is
- **Safety**: Does the system prevent making serious/unrecoverable errors, provide means of recovering from errors, undo options, confirmation dialogs, protect users from dangerous and undesirable conditions
- **Utility**: Sufficient functionality to accommodate
range of user tasks, without complex
workarounds or hacks
- **Learnability**: How easy is the system to learn
- **Memorability**: Once learned, how easy is the system to
remember?

## User Experience Goals:

Some experience goals include:
- Satisfying: productive
- Motivating: did not feel like giving up
- Enjoyable: no frustrations were encountered
- Aesthetically pleasing: subjective
- Fun: excited about using it again
- Supportive of creativity: drawing tools
- Entertaining: games
- Rewarding: sense of productivity
- Helpful: clueless but still made it through
- Emotionally fulfilling: evokes emotions/online chatting



# Intro to UCD


Users and their goals should influence design. Users are consulted throughout the process and
their feedback is fed back into the design
